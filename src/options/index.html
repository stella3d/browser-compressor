        <div class="header">Usage / Supported Sites</div>

        For this first release, a handful of sites are explicitly supported, instead of working across everything.  
        The reasons for this are multiple:
        <ol>
            <li>
                This only works with HTML "audio" & "video" tags.</br>
                Some sites (such as SoundCloud) use a custom setup that does not use these tags.
            </li></br>
            <li>
                Some sites (like Steam or Crunchyroll) keep their actual media content on another domain (such as a static cdn)
                Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions prevent this extension from accessing their audio.
            </li></br>
            <li>
              Chrome's permission model for extensions makes doing content script injection on-demand for arbitrary sites tricky, and i haven't figured it out yet.
            </li></br>
            <li>
            I don't have access to an account to test most paywalled streaming services
            </li>
        </ol>
    
        Wider site support is a top priority for future development. 
        </br>
        The list of currently supported sites is:
        <ul>
            <li class="bold">Twitch</li>
            <li class="bold">Twitter/Periscope</li>
            <li class="bold">Facebook</li>
            <li class="bold">Amazon video</li>
            <li class="bold">CBS All Access</li>
            <li class="bold">Vimeo</li>
            <li class="bold">Mixcloud</li>
        </ul>
        Direct links to files are also supported, for 
        <ul>
            <li class="bold">mp3/4</li>
            <li class="bold">webm</li>
            <li class="bold">ogg</li>
        </ul>
        Apologies for the inconvenience if your favorite isn't supported yet, this extension is very new.

            There are currently no settings aside from those shown in the pop-up, but they will be here when added.

        <div>
            This extension allows you to apply 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range_compression">
                dynamic range compression
            </a> 
            to audio on the web.  
            </br></br>
            Compression reduces the amount that volume varies , which can be more comfortable for media with a lot of variation.

            of the wiki entry explains the common terms used in the controls, such as: 
            <div class="boldmono">'threshold', 'ratio', 'attack', 'release'</div>
