        <div class="header">Usage</div>
        To use, click the extension's icon when you're on a page with media you want to adjust the volume range of.</br></br>
        
        You should see a small popup with multiple sliders on the bottom, and one large toggle switch on the top.</br>
        Click that toggle switch, and if media is found on the page that we can work with, the popup UI will turn on along with the effect.</br></br>
        
        Sliders control the parameters of the effect.</br>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range_compression#Controls_and_features">
            This section
        </a> 
        of the wiki entry explains the common terms used in the controls, such as: 
        <div class="boldmono">'threshold', 'ratio', 'attack', 'release'</div>
        </br>

        <div class="subhead">Latency</div></br>
        There is a very small (less than 10ms) amount of latency inherent to WebAudio, but i have not noticed it when watching video - this is less than a frame.

        <div class="header">Website Support</div></br>
        For this first release, a handful of sites are explicitly supported, instead of working across everything.  
        The reasons for this are multiple:
        <ol>
            <li>
                This only works with HTML "audio" & "video" tags.</br>
                Some sites (such as SoundCloud) use a custom setup that does not use these tags.
            </li></br>
            <li>
                Some sites (like Steam or Crunchyroll) keep their actual media content on another domain (such as a static cdn), and
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">
                    Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
                </a> (CORS) restrictions prevent this extension from accessing their audio.
            </li></br>
            <li>
              Chrome's permission model for extensions makes doing content script injection on-demand for arbitrary sites tricky, and i haven't figured it out yet.
            </li></br>
            <li>
            I don't have access to an account to test most paywalled streaming services
            </li>
        </ol>
    
        <div class="subhead">Currently Supported</div>
        <ul>
            <li class="bold">Twitch</li>
            <li class="bold">Twitter/Periscope</li>
            <li class="bold">Facebook</li>
            <li class="bold">Amazon video</li>
            <li class="bold">CBS All Access</li>
            <li class="bold">Vimeo</li>
            <li class="bold">Mixcloud</li>
        </ul>
        Direct links to files are also supported, for 
        <ul>
            <li class="bold">mp3/4</li>
            <li class="bold">webm</li>
            <li class="bold">ogg</li>
        </ul>

        Wider site support is a top priority for future development. </br>
        Apologies for the inconvenience if your favorite isn't supported yet - it may not be possible, and this extension is very new.

            There are currently no settings aside from those shown in the pop-up, but they will be here when added.

            This extension allows you to apply 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range_compression">
                dynamic range compression
            </a> 
            to audio on the web.  
            </br></br>
            Compression reduces the amount that volume varies , which can be more comfortable for media with a lot of variation.
